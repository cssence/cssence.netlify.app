# cssence.netlify.app

This site is primarily not a site, but a single file, where I test stuff.

See live version under https://cssence.betlify.app/.

## Setup

To be used as is, zero dependencies, no build script.

The `/public` folder is source and hosted version at the same time. Ideally, point an [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) of your choice there.
